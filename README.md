# 🏏 Cricket Performance Analysis – ICC Champions Trophy 2025

Welcome to my comprehensive **Cricket Performance Analysis** project using **Google Sheets**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**! This end-to-end analysis covers everything from data collection and cleaning to insightful performance analytics and engaging visual storytelling.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores team and player performances, match dynamics, and outcome trends. I structured the data into a relational database and used SQL to derive powerful insights that help understand the championship’s story. I then brought those insights to life through an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.

## 📊 Data Collection & Cleaning

- ✔ Collected datasets on **Batting**, **Bowling**, and **Match Performance**
- ✔ Used **Google Sheets** for initial cleaning: removed duplicates & null values
- ✔ Refined and normalized the data using **MySQL**
- ✔ Handled inconsistencies and enforced data integrity

> **Data Source**: Kaggle (based on ICC Official Match Data)

## 🧱 Database & Table Design

Structured MySQL tables to enable efficient querying and analysis:

- `batting_performance`
- `bowling_performance`
- `match_details`
- `player_info`
- `team_standings`

**Highlights**:
- Normalized relational schema with **primary and foreign keys**
- Built for analytical querying and reporting
- Includes **SQL scripts in PDF format** (see `sql_scripts/` folder)
